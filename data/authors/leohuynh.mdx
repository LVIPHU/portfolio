I'm Tuan Anh Huynh (alias Leo at work), a software engineer from Vietnam. I have a passion for all things Javascript. I enjoy building eCommerce software and stuff related to web dev. I work mainly with Typescript, React, NodeJS, Remix, and TailwindCSS.

This blog serves as a journal for documenting and sharing the insights and knowledge I've gained as a software engineer. Building, writing, and sharing things is a great way for me to solidify my understanding of new concepts and ideas.

I would greatly appreciate any comments and thoughts on my posts
